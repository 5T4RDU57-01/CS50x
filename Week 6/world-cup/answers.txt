Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The prediction of france and italy winning the tournament proved incorrect i.e: the predictions got more accurate

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After about 10000 simulations as beyond this point, the results didn't change much and the runtime increase became directly proportional to the number of simuations
