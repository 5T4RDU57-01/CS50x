i) I would characterize the person's audio aura as "High energy but less positive songs that they can dance to".
ii) This aura may not be representative of the listener as it was calculated using only three metrics and using just the top 100 songs.
    Better ways to calculate this arua might include: using a larger number of songs, using more metrics such as tempo, genre and the tone of the lyrics.
